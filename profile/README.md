### Twin builds autonomous agents that are reliable and scalable enough for companies to actually delegate work to them.

We engineered the first commercial agent deployed to 500,000 SMBs—Invoice Operator—achieving over 95% accuracy at a fraction of the human cost. In the coming months, we expect this first agent to fully automate millions of man-hours. We're already embedded in Qonto's app (the largest european B2B neobank) and will announce soon other major partnerships.

To achieve this, we built (among other things):

- A Rust-based browser infrastructure delivering low latency at high scale and concurrency
- A password manager that enables automated, secure agent authentication and 2FA solving
- A graph-based agentic framework that makes complex agents robust through decoupling
- A self-correcting infrastructure that allows agents to learn from mistakes and improve as they encounter new challenges

Founded in 2024, we’ve raised €12M from LocalGlobe and unicorn founders including those behind Hugging Face, Datadog, and Alan.

Beyond scaling our first agent, our goal is to launch & distribute our next hit agents and ultimately become the trusted layer where autonomous work runs.
