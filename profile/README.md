[Twin](https://twin.so) builds autonomous agents that are reliable and scalable enough for companies to actually delegate work to them.

We engineered the first commercial agent deployed to 500,000 SMBs—[Invoice Operator](https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/27/twins-first-ai-agent-is-an-invoice-retrieval-agent-for-qonto-customers/)—achieving over 95% accuracy at a fraction of the human cost. In the coming months, we expect this first agent to fully automate millions of man-hours. We're already embedded in Qonto's app (the largest european B2B neobank) and will announce soon other major partnerships.

To achieve this, we built (among other things):

- A **Rust-based browser infrastructure** delivering low latency at high scale and concurrency
- A **password manager** that enables automated, secure agent authentication and 2FA solving
- A **graph-based agentic framework** that makes complex agents robust through decoupling
- A **self-correcting infrastructure** that allows agents to learn from mistakes and improve as they encounter new challenges

Founded in 2024, we’ve raised €12M from [LocalGlobe](https://www.phoenixcourt.vc/localglobe) and unicorn founders including Hugging Face, Datadog, and Alan.

Beyond scaling our first agent, our next milestone is to launch our next hit agents - in partnership with our customers - and ultimately become the trusted layer where autonomous work runs.
